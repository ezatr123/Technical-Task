Task 3 part D:

•	I could ask the user to enter a list of words directly into the console. Within the code, I could write a few lines which are dedicated to obtaining input from the user. The ‘Console.WriteLine()’ can be used (without parameters) to do this. The input will be stored in an array. This array could then be passed to the ‘Task3C’ class as a parameter to the function (it would require including an extra parameter to the already implemented function).

•	Another way could be storing a file in the same directory as the project and then obtaining the contents of the file and using that as the censored word list.

•	Could use the ‘WWW’ library and obtain strings from the web – a fair amount of string formatting and splicing would be needed, however, and so this might not be a efficient way of doing it. It is possible however.
